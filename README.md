# More Suits v1.1.0
### Adds more suits to choose from, and allows you to customize them!

## Instructions
Place the ```x753-More_Suits-X.X.X``` folder in your ```BepInEx/Plugins``` folder. Make sure the ```suits``` folder is in the same folder as ```MoreSuits.dll```.

## Customize
You can add .png files to the ```suits``` folder to add new suits as long as both the host and clients have the same files.

## Advanced
You can add a .json file in the ```advanced``` folder with the same name as your .png file in the ```suits``` folder to enable additional features like emission. Place additional texture maps in the ```advanced``` folder.
